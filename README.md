# Absence Requests Management

The Absence Requests Management project is constructed using Spring Boot and React.js.

This project is designed to provide a practical application of the fundamental concepts of Spring Boot for backend development.

## Features:
- User registration and login functionalities are available for accessing the minimalist dashboard.
- Users can submit absence requests to their respective managers.
- Multiple roles are implemented, including user, manager, and admin. The admin role is granted the privilege to manage users by adding or removing them, as well as assigning or unassigning roles to users.
- Both managers and admins have the authority to approve or decline any absence request.

The authentication and authorization system are implemented using Spring Security, ensuring secure access to the application.

PostgreSQL is employed as the project's database for data storage and retrieval.
